# 🧠 Neural Network Digit Recognizer (from Scratch)

This project implements a basic Neural Network from scratch using **Python** and **NumPy** to recognize handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. It aims to provide a deep understanding of how neural networks work under the hood — without using any machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 📌 Features

- Built entirely using **NumPy** (no ML frameworks)
- Trained on **MNIST** dataset (0–9 digits)
- Supports forward propagation, backpropagation, and training using gradient descent
- Visualizes accuracy during training using **Matplotlib**
